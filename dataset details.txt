🔍 Overview
Goal: Predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical and diagnostic attributes.

Type: Tabular data, used for binary classification.

Target Variable: target (0 = no heart disease, 1 = presence of heart disease)

📊 Features (Columns)
Column Name	Description
age	Age of the patient (in years)
sex	Sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp	Chest pain type (0–3):
- 0: typical angina
- 1: atypical angina
- 2: non-anginal pain
- 3: asymptomatic
trestbps	Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol	Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl)
fbs	Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
restecg	Resting electrocardiographic results:
- 0: normal
- 1: ST-T wave abnormality
- 2: left ventricular hypertrophy
thalach	Maximum heart rate achieved
exang	Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
oldpeak	ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope	Slope of the peak exercise ST segment:
- 0: upsloping
- 1: flat
- 2: downsloping
ca	Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal	Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect)
target	Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)

📌 Notes
Originally, the dataset had 76 attributes, but this subset (from the Cleveland database) uses only 14 commonly studied features.

This dataset is clean, though some versions contain missing values represented by ? (especially in ca and thal).

target was originally a multi-class variable (0–4), but is often binarized for classification tasks.

✅ Use Cases
Classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, etc.

Feature engineering: One-hot encoding categorical variables like cp, thal, slope

Model evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix
